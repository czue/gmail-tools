gmail-tools
===========

Tools for querying your gmail inbox.

See the quickstart guide for instructions on how to get setup with a gmail developer app: https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/quickstart/quickstart-python.

Right now this just supports passing in a search term to your inbox, and dumping the results in a machine readable csv format for future analysis.
